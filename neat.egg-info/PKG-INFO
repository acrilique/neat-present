# neat-present - Image Presentation Tool
Welcome to **Neat**, an image presentation tool.

**Linux only**, at least for now.

## Purpose
Take an image and make a presentation out of it. Useful for diagrams, flowcharts, etc. 
The output file format of the app is just a json with the image base64 encoded and the coordinates of the points for the presentation.

## Installation
Create a virtual environment, activate it and run:
```bash
pip install neat
neat
```
Then it will create a desktop entry in ~/.local/share/applications/.
